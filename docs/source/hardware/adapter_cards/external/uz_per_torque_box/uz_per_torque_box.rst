General description
*******************

This PCB is designed to supply external torque sensor `Burster 8656 Torque Sensor <https://www.burster.com/en/torque-sensors/p/detail/8656/>`_  and send the signals to the :ref:`Analog_LTC2311_16` Card
The supply is taken from the voltage interface connector of an :ref:`Analog_LTC2311_16` board.
The torque signal (+-10V) is reduced to a level of +-5V and low-pass filtered. 
The torque signal is connected to ADC1 channel of LTC2311 and the remaining 3 Channels ADC2-ADC 4 can still be used without limitations.

  Functional areas of the uz per torque pcb

Layout
------

The PCB is structured by functional areas as shown in the :numref:`torque_box_function` on the right.


1. Double Ethernet connector to the ADC adapter board
2. Measurement signal adaption to +-5V and low-pass filtering (708 Hz).
3. Supply voltage 24V and 5V from ADC Card with Samtec cable ``MMSD-08-28-F-xx.xx-D-K-LDX`` 
4. Connector to the Torque Sensor D-Sub 15  

A lot of details, as well as the pin configuration are described in the schematic (see download section below).

Assembly and Connection
*************************

A 3D-printable housing and an engraved aluminum cover designed for the uz_per_torque_box PCB. 
The assembly with all necessary parts is shown below, including a bill of materials (BOM). The PCB can be used without the housing, 
but it is more rugged and much more beautiful with the housing.

After the assembly the PCB can be connected to the UZ, e.g. to Slot A from ADC A1
