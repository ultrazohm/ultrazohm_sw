Create your own extension boards
================================

The UltraZohm Project is a work in progress project and you can contribute on it.
If you feel that a hardware component is missing feel free to fork the template project
for a `Digital Adapter Card <https://bitbucket.org/ultrazohm/ultrazohm_digital_template/>`_
or for an `Analog Adapter Card <https://bitbucket.org/ultrazohm/ultrazohm_analog_template/>`_

Guidelines
----------

If you create an extension card please make sure you follow the guidlines:

* Include a version number. It follows the scheme <major_revision>v<minor_revision>. The major revisions are typically produced in hardware and minor revisions are revisions in the layout without producing the PCB.
* Include the designer of the PCB with optionally a contact (e.g. QR-Code or e-mail address).
* Before releasing the PCB to the project make sure it is fully tested.
* Create a page in these docs corresponding to the other pages for adapter cards.
