General description
********
This PCB is used for the :ref:`adc_loopback` tutorial. 
The LEDs indicate the state of the signals from the digital voltage card (:ref:`digitalVoltage`). 
Furthermore eight of the twelve gate signals are filtered and can be looped back to the ADC card (:ref:`Analog_LTC2311_16_v3`, :ref:`Analog_LTC2311_16_v2` ) via Ethernet connector.
