========================
Overview of the ARM Pins
========================

In the following table you will find an overview of the pin mapping of the SoC MIO pins (fixed pins of the SoC's Processing System).
All connector-accessible MIO pins -- i.e., those having an X... assignment in column **CB-Pin** -- are labeled with the associated net label/name (of the carrier board) in the fifth column and the connector pin in the **CB-Pin** column (CB --> Carrier Board).
The connectivity between MIO pins and the frontpanel I/Os -- four user LEDs and three buttons -- is shown by column **FP_**.

Itemized list of MIO-related changes next to :ref:`carrier_board_rev4_mio`:

- The retrofitted Ethernet PHY resets on Rev04 (cf. :ref:`carrier_known_issues_ethrst`) are moved from MIO26/27 to the S³C

	- MIO26 becomes a PMU spare (with IRQ capability)
	- MIO27 becomes part of DPaux

- Three LEDs (PS_1V8_GPIO2/3/4) on MIO33/34/39 and two frontpanel switches (PS_1V8_GPIO5/7) on MIO40/30 are moved to MIO56-60

	- MIO30 becomes DPaux (with MIO27-29)
	- MIO33 becomes a PMU spare
	- MIO34 becomes CS1 of SPI1
	- MIO39 becomes CS2 of SPI0
	- MIO40 becomes CS1 of SPI0

- The "External STOP" (isoEmergencyStop) on MIO31 is moved to MIO61, making room for a PMU spare (without IRQ capability)
- ``PS_ANL_sharedA`` on MIO45 is moved to MIO62, making room for CD of the µSD
- MIO52 is reserved for the PCIe reset
- The remaining isoGPIOs (MIO53-55) are assigned to power messaging (i.e., a ready-to-poweroff output and -- optionally, as the APU shall use I²C for it -- a power button input), an SMBus-like IRQ line for the user I²C and a reset for its bus mux/switch

Note that all changes affect only MIO pins that are used as GPIO in Rev04, which

- makes the Vivado design of Rev04 compatible to Rev05 (as GPIO remapping is already supported in software, cf. the ``uz_MioGpio`` module or the :ref:`uzpA53`), and
- limits (eventually required) changes to the Vivado design solely(!) to making any of the aforementioned new hardware features available, at a later point in time.
