Detailed Description
-----------------------
This digital adapter card is based on the LTC2983 temperature measurement system.
With the ability to measure different sensor types and build-in data preparation this card extends the functionality of the Ultrazohm. The total amount of 60-Channels (40 on the frontpanel, 20 internal) could be wired directly on the card or in the plug for different kind of sensors.

IP-Core
-----------------------
The temperature card is provided with an IP-core, which handles the configuration and triggers a periodical measurement. For this purpose the core contains a memory-mapped-interface, which stores the channel configurations and a freely configurable trigger-generator. To get the temperature card working, its neccessary to connect the IP-core via smart connects to the PS and map the IP-core Pins to the dedicated digital Slot, further the IP-Core is designed to work with an 100MHz clock. 

It's crucial to use the Pins as shown in the picture below, otherwise the mapping won't fit with the created CPLD-File!

To generate the needed channel configuration, it's neccessary to read the datasheet of the `LTC2983 <https://www.analog.com/en/products/ltc2983.html>`_. For easier use of the card, there exists a C-library.
The library contains functions to provide a simple way to configure and read the Temperature Card.

How the driver could be used
--------------------------------
This library provide an easy way to use the UZ_Temperature_Card.
For easier handling, the library uses an internal structure to mirror the Registers of the Interface-IP.
The Channels can be addressed by values from 0-59 and all needed address calculation will be performed internally.
(Software Channel 0-19 equals Hardware Channel_A 0-19, Software Channel 20-39 equals Hardware Channel_B 0-19 and Software Channel 40-59 equals Hardware Channel_C 0-19).
