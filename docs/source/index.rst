The UltraZohm is a powerful real-time computation platform for research, development, and rapid-control prototyping of power electronics and drive systems.
Development is driven by researchers for researchers to establish a common control platform.
Having a common platform enables the active research community to focus on publication and results, while platform development is a shared effort. 


**High Computational power**

The UltraZohm is based on `Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC <https://www.xilinx.com/products/silicon-devices/soc/zynq-ultrascale-mpsoc.html>`_ (EG devices).
These offer four ARM A53, two ARM R5, and a large FPGA (programmable logic - PL) in one System-on-a-Chip (SoC).
The UltraScale is used with a System-on-a-Module (SoM) from `Trenz Electronic GmbH <https://www.trenz-electronic.de/de/>`_. specifically the `TE0808 with a ZU9EG <https://shop.trenz-electronic.de/de/TE0808-05-9GI21-A-UltraSOM-MPSoC-Modul-mit-Zynq-UltraScale-XCZU9EG-2FFVC900I-4-GB-DDR4>`_ device is the default and strongly recommended.
Additionally, SoM with devices from 2EG (TE0803) to 15EG (TE0808) can be used with the UltraZohm framework out of the box using the :ref:`viavdo_build_tcl`.

**Hard real-time**

The UltraZohm is designed to meet modern control systems' timing requirements for power electronics.
Thus, the control frequency of the real-time processor is in the range of :math:`10\,\mu s` to :math:`100\,\mu s`, depending on the specific application.
Additionally, many modern control algorithms such as model predictive control (MPC) and machine learning methods can be accelerated by using the PL (FPGA) of the UltraZohm.
Therefore, the system is optimized for this approach.

**Open Source**

The UltraZohm is a platform with no black boxes and no barriers to your research.
It is built with the intent to give users full control and the ability to easily adapt the system to their specific needs and preferences.
Therefore, UltraZohm project is licensed by Apache 2.0 and the hardware is licensed under CERN-OHL-P.
See :ref:`license_target` for details.

**Modularity**

The UltraZohm is modular regarding the UltraScale device to scale the computational power.
The community continuously extends the platform with more hardware components, especially :ref:`adapter_cards` for which templates and libraries exist.
Furthermore, IP-Cores and software components are developed and shared, and included in the project.

**Usability**

The UltraZohm project thrives to be novice friendly with tutorials and an existing codebase.
This is especially relevant to onboard new users with different backgrounds, ranging from bachelor, master's, and PhD students to experienced engineers and developers.
At the same time, the system is expert friendly with access *to the last bit* due to the lack of black boxes, access to the source code, and comprehensive documentation.
In addition, there are multiple supported workflows for writing software (e.g., manually or using :ref:`embedded_coder`) and IP-Cores (manually, :ref:`hdl_coder`, Vitis HLS).

**Community**

The UltraZohm community aims to connect researchers working on the same platform and solve infrastructure problems only once!
We write and review code together, design PCBs, and share our knowledge regarding the UltraZohm, Xilinx UltraScale, electronics, control approaches, and many more!
We welcome researchers from all around the world with an interest in the control of power electronics and electrical drives.

**Documentation**

Comprehensive and ever-growing documentation for the Ultrazohm on `docs.ultrazohm.com <https://docs.ultrazohm.com/>`_.

**Repositories**

The UltraZohm repositories are split in software and hardware:

- The `main repository ultrazohm_sw <https://bitbucket.org/ultrazohm/ultrazohm_sw>`_ contains the source code for the processors, FPGA, documentation, CI pipelines and more.
- The `PCB Designs <https://bitbucket.org/ultrazohm/workspace/projects/PCB>`_ lists all adapter card repositories, where each repository contains its Altium PCB project. Additionally, each PCB’s documentation page links to its respective repository.

**Maintained & funded**

Project development is funded by the `BMBF with the research grant KI-Power <https://elektronikforschung.de/projekte/ki-power>`_ and is actively maintained by the `Institute ELSYS of TH Nuremberg <https://www.th-nuernberg.de/einrichtungen-gesamt/in-institute/institut-fuer-leistungselektronische-systeme-elsys/>`_ as well as the `Chair of High-Power Converter Systems (HLU) of TU Munich <https://www.epe.ed.tum.de/en/eal/home/>`_.
In addition, researchers of TH Nuremberg and TU Munich founded the start-up `Zohm Control GmbH <https://zohm-control.com/>`_ to ensure the long term development of the system and to be able to distribute the fully assembled UltraZohm systems.

UltraZohm Community Slack
*************************

- The UltraZohm community is organized using Slack
- Join the `UltraZohm Slack <https://join.slack.com/t/ultrazohm/shared_invite/zt-l6mbbef6-2HNXR21vT_5TRT4l2J1pNw>`_ 


Acquiring an UltraZohm
**********************

- Please contact the commercial manufacturer `Zohm Control GmbH <https://zohm-control.com/>`_ of the UltraZohm to purchase a system
- Alternatively, one can build and manufacture the system on their own since the project is licensed as open source and open source hardware (see :ref:`license_target`)
- Note that while one is under no obligation to do so according to the licenses, it is advised to get in touch before building the system on your own
- Write us at info@ultrazohm.com or ask in the Slack channel if you have questions regarding building or purchasing a system

Contributing
************

- We are accepting and welcoming contributions
- Forking & creating a pull request is possible for everybody (see `fork a repository documentation <https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/fork-a-repository/>`_)
- In principle, documentation, software, and even IP-Cores can be developed and contributed without physical access to an UltraZohm
- For IP-Cores, developing with a generic UltraScale development kit is advised
- While we try to reduce the barrier for contributions, physical access to an UltraZohm is often required
- Contributes can get in contact by mail or Slack to the maintainers to get write access to the repository and switch to a feature-branch workflow (see :ref:`contribution`) 
- `Open in Gitpod <https://gitpod.io/#https://bitbucket.org/ultrazohm/ultrazohm_sw/src/main/>`_ for contributing without tool setup
