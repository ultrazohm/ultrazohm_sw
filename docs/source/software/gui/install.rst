3. If it displays something different than your installed version (e.g. version 1.8), you may have installed some Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
    - Solution A: If you don't need explicitly the JRE --> uninstall it
    - Solution B: Check your PATH variable JAVA_HOME if it points to your JDK installation
