How to set encoder offset
=========================

Motor control often relies on using the rotating dq-reference frame.
The rotating dq-reference frame for permanent magnet synchronous machines (PMSM) is aligned with the d-axis and relies on the knowledge of the angle :math:`\vartheta` between d-axis and :math:`\alpha` axis.
The angle :math:`\vartheta` can be measured or estimated and is used in the transformation, e.g., using :ref:`uz_transformation`.
Additionally, machine models in dq-frame assume this alignment.
Several different encoder technologies exist, e.g., :ref:`ipCore_incremental_encoder`.
The encoder reference (the zero-point of the encoder) is not necessarily aligned with the d-axis of the machine.

   Alignment of encoder with respect to the :math:`\alpha`-axis and d-axis

This alignment is shown in fig. :numref:`encoder_alignment_picture` with the angle :math:`\vartheta_m` between the :math:`\alpha`-axis and the d-axis and the encoder offset :math:`\vartheta_{m,offset}` between the :math:`\alpha`-axis of the machine and the encoder reference.
The following methods for setting the offset are commonly used for PMSM:

#. Duty cycle on the :math:`a` phase
#. No-torque by d-current
#. Back-EMF
#. Flux-based (open circuit)
#. Flux-based (controlled)


Duty cycle on the :math:`a`-phase 
=================================

The linked flux of the :math:`a`-phase winding is aligned with the :math:`\alpha`-axis of the machine.
The main idea in this offset estimation is to drive a current through the :math:`a`-phase of the machine, which generates a linked magnetic flux leading the d-axis with the permanent magnet to mechanically turn and align with the :math:`alpha`-axis of the machine.
This can be achieved by stepping the duty cycle of the :math:`a`-phase from zero to an arbitrary duty cycle.
The duty cycle is kept on its value and the current angle :math:`\vartheta_m` is set as :math:`\vartheta_{m,offset}`.
Since the method does not use a closed loop current control, a duty cycle has to be chosen that does not lead to a phase current above the rated current of the machine.
However, the duty cycle has to be sufficiently large to move the rotor reliably into the :math:`\alpha` axis.
This method is quick but results in sub-optimal alignment, requires manual tuning of the duty cycle and is often unreliable in the laboratory.
Additionally, :math:`L_d=L_q` is assumed.

                 \legend{$T_{PM}$,$T_{Rel}$,$T_I$}
             \end{axis}

The figure left showcases the relationship between current angle :math:`\beta` and machine torque with the torque generated by the reluctance effect :math:`T_{Rel}`, the torque generated by the linked flux of the permanent magnet :math:`T_{PM}` and the sum of both torque components :math:`T_{I}` (the inner torque of the machine).
The current angle :math:`\beta` describes the angle between the q-axis and the space vector of the stator current :math:`\underline{i}=i_d + ji_q` (with the imaginary unit :math:`j`).
Therefore, :math:`\beta=\arctan{\big( \frac{-i_d}{i_q} \big) }`.
For machines with :math:`L_d=L_q` only the green torque curve applies.
Therefore, current in the :math:`a`-phase prompts the rotor to move into the :math:`\alpha`-axis aligning the peak of the torque with the d-axis.
If :math:`L_d \neq L_q`, the green curve is superimposed with the blue curve yielding the resulting torque (black line).
Thus, current in the :math:`a`-phase does not align the :math:`\alpha`-axis with the d-axis but with an angle that is skewed depending on the specific values of the inductances :math:`L_d`, :math:`L_q`, and flux linkage of the permanent magnet :math:`\psi_{PM}`.
The method for determining the encoder offset :math:`\vartheta_{m,offset}` must therefore not be used on machine with :math:`L_d \neq L_q`.

Pro:

- Quick & easy

Con:

- Assumes :math:`L_d = L_q`
- Manual estimation of end-value for duty cycle step (high enough to move the rotor, not too high to damage machine)
- No closed-loop control to prevent exceeding rated current of the machine

No-torque by d-current
======================

A possible alternative to driving current through the :math:`a`-phase of the machine is to ensure that no torque is generated if :math:`i_q=0` and :math:`i_d \neq 0` since the PMSM does not generate torque in this case [#Schroeder_Regelung]_:

.. math::

    T_I=\frac{3}{2} p \big(i_q \psi_{pm} + i_d i_q (L_d -L_q) \big)

This alignment method uses a closed-loop current control and control the set-points :math:`i_q^*=0` and :math:`i_d^* \neq 0`.
Using a torque sensor on the test bench (as described in [[#rahman_encoder_offset]_]), the encoder offset can manually be adjusted until the torque sensor measures zero torque.
The set-point for the current :math:`i_d` depends on the machine under test.

Pro:

- Simple concept
- Suitable for :math:`L_d \neq L_q`

Con:

- Manual
- Requires torque sensor
- Accuracy of torque sensor determines accuracy of encoder offset

Back-EMF
========

Alignment of the encoder and the d-axis can be achieved if the zero-crossing of the back-EMF and the position signal is aligned as shown in :numref:`encoder_alignment_backemf` [[#rahman_encoder_offset]_].
However, this method for determining the encoder offset :math:`\vartheta_{m,offset}` requires that the machine under test is driven by an external machine to a fixed rotational speed and the back-EMF as well as the encoder signal are measured by one oscilloscope or the controller.
The machine under test is operated with open circuit, i.e., :math:`i_d=i_q=0`.
If the back-EMF should be measured by the controller, a phase voltage measurement is required on the power electronics.
Voltage measurement on the power electronics is not always available and if it is, usually a low pass filter is included which adds a phase lag to the measured voltage which has to be accounted for when aligning the encoder.
Furthermore, the position alignment does not account for iron-losses.

Flux-based (open circuit)
=========================

The flux based encoder alignment is based on the induced voltage (back-EMF) and uses the same operating condition as the back-EMF based method.
The machine under test for which the encoder offset should be determined is driven by an test bench machine to a fixed speed (open circuit, thus :math:`I_d=I_q=0`).
In steady state, the voltage equations of the PMSM are given by [[#kellner_diss]_,p. 16]:

.. math::

  \begin{align}
  U_d &=R_1 I_d - \omega_{el} L_q I_q \\
  U_q &=R_1 I_q + \omega_{el} L_d I_d + \omega_{el} \psi_{PM}
  \end{align}

With :math:`I_d=0` and :math:`I_q=0` due to open circuit, the equations simplify to:

.. math::

  \begin{align}
  U_d &=0 \\
  U_q &=0 + \omega_{el} \psi_{PM}
  \end{align}

Therefore, the encoder offset is changed manually until :math:`U_d=0` and :math:`U_q=\omega_{el} \psi_{PM}`.
However, this approach does not work due to iron losses in the machine and the alignment is skewed.

.. _pmsm_esb_iron_losses:

.. figure:: pmsm_esb.svg
   :width: 800px
   :align: center

   Equivalent circuit of PMSM including iron losses of d-axis (left) and q-axis (right) [[#kellner_diss]_, p. 71, [#Schroeder_Regelung]_, p. 1102]. 

:numref:`pmsm_esb_iron_losses` shows the equivalent circuit of the PMSM including iron losses.
With the parallel iron resistance :math:`R_c`, the voltage equations of the PMSM in steady state can be written as:

.. math::

  \begin{align}
  U_d &=R_1 I_d + R_c I_{d0} \\
  U_q &=R_1 I_q + R_c I_{q0}
  \end{align}  

Therefore, the encoder offset to match :math:`U_d=0` and :math:`U_q=\omega_{el} \psi_{PM}` does not lead to an alignment of the dq-frame to the d-axis the aforementioned operating conditions using open circuit with :math:`I_d=I_q=0` and :math:`\omega_{el}\neq 0`.
This is the case since the induced voltage :math:`\omega_{el}\psi_d` leads to the iron loss current :math:`I_{q0}` and the current :math:`I_{q0}` generates the flux linkage :math:`-\omega_{el} \psi_q` [[#richter_diss]_, p. 44].
Instead, the encoder offset :math:`\vartheta_m` is manually adjusted for positive and negative rotational speeds.
The dq-frame is aligned with the d-axis if :math:`U_q` changes the sign for positive and negative rotational speed but not its magnitude and the value for :math:`U_d` does not change when changing the direction.
