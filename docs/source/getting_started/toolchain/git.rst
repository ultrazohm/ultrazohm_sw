Installation
------------

The version control of the source files of the UltraZohm is done by git.
Therefore, a git installation is needed: <https://git-scm.com/downloads>.
The homepage of git offers excellent documentation <https://git-scm.com/doc>, tutorials, and videos <https://git-scm.com/videos>.
Another recommended tutorial is offered by Bitbucket <https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials>.
An understanding of git is mandatory for working with the UltraZohm and is assumed in the following sections!

A graphical git client can be used to simplify the usage of git.
**Sourcetree** <https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/> (Free, Windows and Mac) or **GitKraken** <https://www.gitkraken.com> (paid for private repositories, free for students and research institutions/non-profit, Windows, Mac, Linux) is recommended.

Git Bash
--------

If you are comfortable with git bash / CLI tool you can use it without the GUI client.
