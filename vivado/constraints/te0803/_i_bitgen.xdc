# This file was auto-generated using the python script process_xdc.py
# The script has as input the original constraints. Pinout info is extracted from
# Trenz pinout sheet (obtained from https://shop.trenz-electronic.de/Download/?path=Trenz_Electronic/Pinout) 
# into csv files with the C-PIN, C-NAME, FPGA Pin Name, and Module Net Name columns.
# Obs.: Column order is not important, but names need to be strictly followed.
#
# Constraints ported from TE0808_REV02.csv to TE0803_REV02.csv.
