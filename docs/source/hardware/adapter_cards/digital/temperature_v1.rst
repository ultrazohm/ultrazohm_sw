Temperature Card V1 
==========================

Detailed Description
-----------------------
Extends the UltraZohm with a temperature measurement ability. This digital adapter card is based on the LTC2983 temperature measurement system.
With the ability to measure different sensor types and build-in data preparation this card extends the functionality of the Ultrazohm.
The total amount of 60-Channels (40 on the frontpanel, 20 internal) could be wired directly on the card or in the plug for different kind of sensors.

Functionality
-----------------------
Based on the LTC2983:

* Directly Digitize RTDs, Thermocouples, Thermistors, and Diodes
* Results Reported in 째C or 째F
* 20 Flexible Inputs Allow Interchanging Sensors
* Automatic Thermocouple Cold Junction Compensation
* Built-In Standard and User-Programmable Coefficients for Thermocouples, RTDs and Thermistors
* Configurable 2-, 3- or 4-Wire RTD Configurations
* Measures Negative Thermocouple Voltages
* Automatic Burn Out, Short-Circuit and Fault Detection
* Simultaneous 50Hz/60Hz Rejection
* Includes 10ppm/째C (max) Reference (I-Grade)
* 3 Galvanic isolated LTC2983 available (2 reachable directly on the Front, 1 could be reached with riser-cable)
* build-in RC-lowpass filter for each channel
* on-board-wiring for easy channel/sensor configuration

Before first use
----------------------------
* Determine correct placement options for correct function
* Program CPLDs with the firmware needed for the temperature card, see :ref:`label_cpld_programming` for details
* DOUBLE CHECK the directions of the dedicated pins of the IP-core to the temperature card.

Compatibility 
----------------------
* The version of this card is compatible with slots D1-D4. D5 could be used with an own CPLD-File.

Pinout
----------------------
The pinout is identical for each receptacle on the temperature card.

Please be aware that the Channels 1 to 4 are also used for the internal PT100.

IP-Core
-----------------------
The temperature card is provided with an IP-core, which handles the configuration and triggers a periodical measurement.
For this purpose the core contains a memory-mapped-interface, which stores the channel configurations and a freely configurable trigger-generator.
To get the temperature card working, its neccessary to connect the IP-core via smart connects to the PS and map the IP-core Pins to the dedicated digital Slot, further the IP-Core is designed to work with an 100MHz clock. 
The documentation for the IP-Core can be found under :ref:`temperature_card_IPcore_v1`.

Wiring
------------------------
Since there exists many possible configuration for the temperature card, its possible to manage some wiring directly on the PCB.

This area is dedicated to implement RC-lowpass filter (C left, R middle) for use with thermocouples or the placement of the Rsense needed for RTD's.
Further it is possible to enable Rsense-Sharing with 0R-Resistor or solder bridges (R right).
For most usecases this Filter-and-Wiring-Area should be enough, so that 9 RTD's in 2-Wire-mode can be implemented directly without the need of extra wiring.
If more RTD's are needed, the user could extend the amount of sensors by chainig up to 18 RTD's on one LTC (see `LTC_Application_Note <https://www.analog.com/media/en/reference-design-documentation/design-notes/DN1035f.pdf>`_ ), but this requires special wiring which is up to the user.

Known issues
-----------------------
* Wrong naming of the Channels. This results in a wrong assignment of the Channels. On the PCB, Channels A and B are exposes, but the Channels A and C are accessible on the front Panel.
* When using the temperature card with thermocouples, please be aware of a non-optimal connection to the LTC2983 caused by the used connectors.
