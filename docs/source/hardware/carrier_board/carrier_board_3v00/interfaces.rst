X3: CPLD-X6E (D5)
-----------------

Not all 30 digital signals of X6E is fully connected to the FPGA.
X3 is routed to the primary side (1.8 V) of the CPLD.
The factory CPLD software routes these signals of X3 to the X6E pins DIG_01 to DIG06 and DIG_25 to DIG_30.
The direction of the signals can be determined with your user CPLD software code. The factory default is **input**.

X4: Ethernet
------------

This RJ45 connector is used for ethernet communication. You can use standard LAN cables.

X5: Analog adapter
------------------

The board connector X5 is used to connect analog adapter boards to the carrier board.
X5A to X5C features each 10 differential signals, which are routed (impedance controlled) directly to the FPGA at a voltage level of 1.8 V with LVDS standard.
The drive strength of the FPGA pins is configurable (4, 8, 12 or 16 mA) by software in Vivado.
For more information see in `Xilinx documentation <https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/user_guides/ug571-ultrascale-selectio.pdf>`_.
Additionally, there is shared SPI and I2C available on X5.

X6: Digital adapter
-------------------

The board connector X6 is used to connect digital adapter boards to the carrier board.
X6 has 30 IOs (DIG_IO_01 to DIG_IO_30) with a voltage level of 3.3 V which are routed to a CPLD for each digital interface.
The IO signals from X6A, X6B, X6C, X6D are routed via the CPLD to the SoM (J1 to J4).
X6E features 30 IOs of which 12 (DIG_01 to DIG_06 and DIG_25 to DIG_30) are routed from the CPLD to X3 and the other 18 IOs are routed to the FPGA.

X7: Isolated CAN
----------------

The following applies to X7A and X7B:

1. This connectors are used for CAN. X7A is labeled with CAN1 and X7B with CAN2 on the PCB.

2. The CAN interface is operated by the processor.

3. The connector X7A uses ``CAN_0`` and X7B ``CAN_1`` in the processor.

4. The pins are isolated and have a voltage level of 5V.

5. The CAN termination resistors (120 Ohm) are assembled by default (R76A - R77A, R76B - R77B) and can be found with the assembly drawing ``(LINK)``.
