CIL PMSM
========

General description
===================

To use the CIL method for controller development for PMSM, as described in [[#uz_cil_paper1]_][[#uz_cil_paper2]_], several IP-Cores have been created.
A general overview over the available IP-Cores is given here.
Links to the individual Docs pages can be found below, as well as examples for the usage.
Models are available for sixphase and ninephase PMSM.

General setup

   Necessary IP-Cores for CIL

The "X" for the transfromation and pmsm IP-Core serves as placeholder and the respective IP-Cores for the amount of phases should be used.
Individual documentation of the IP-Cores is linked below.

Machine model: :ref:`uz_pmsm_model_9ph_dq`

Transformation: :ref:`uz_pmsm9ph_transformation`

Inverter: :ref:`uz_inverter_3ph`

Flip Flop: :ref:`uz_rs_flip_flop`
