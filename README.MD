The UltraZohm is a powerful real-time computation platform for research, development, and rapid-control prototyping of power electronics and drive systems.
Development is driven from researchers for researches to accelerate research by establishing a common control platform.
Having a common platform enables the active research community to focus on publication and results while the platform development is a shared effort. 

- **High Computational power**: Four ARM A53, two ARM R5 and a large FPGA provided by a Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC.
- **Hard real-time**: Designed to meet the timing requirements of modern control systems for power electronics.
- **Open Source**: Platform with no black-boxes and no barriers for your research. Adapt to your needs and use as you like.
- **Modularity**: Extend the platform with your own hardware (adapter cards), IP-Cores and software components.
- **Usability**: Novice friendly with tutorials and existing codebase. Expert friendly with access *to the last bit*.
- **Community**: Connect to other researches working on the same platform and solve infrastructure problems only once!
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive and ever-growing documentation for the Ultrazohm on [docs.ultrazohm.com](docs.ultrazohm.com).
- **Funded**: Project development is guaranteed due to funding by the [BMBF with the research grant KI-Power](https://elektronikforschung.de/projekte/ki-power).

## Research

The primary use of the UltraZohm is the research of modern control algorithms for power electronics and drive systems:

- Model predictive control of electric drives
- Model predictive control of power electronics systems
- Renewable energy systems
- Multilevel converter including Modular Multilevel Converter (MMC)
- Multi-phase motors (m>3)
- Special electric motor designs (e.g., transverse flux machine, synchronous reluctance motor)
- Machine Learning in drive systems
