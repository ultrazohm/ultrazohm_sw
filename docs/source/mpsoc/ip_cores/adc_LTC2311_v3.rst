Introduction
------------

The IP core ADC_LVDS_LTC2311 in version 3 is designed to read the ADCs
which are located on the :ref:`analog adapter board
<Analog_LTC2311_16_v3>` and to further process the values obtained
from the ADCs. The IP core features an AXI4 Lite interface for
settings and software control. For real time control, the IP core can
be triggered by using a hardware port as well. The raw value from the
ADC and the processed value are available as std_logic_vectors at the
hardware interface of the IP core.

Features
--------


- Up to 32 independent SPI Masters with each up to 32 synchronous
  channels. In total up to 1024 individual ADCs are theoretically
  possible.
- Pipelined addition with an offset value and subsequent
  multiplication with a conversion factor with the following features:

  + Low resource footprint due to pipelined setup
  + Each individual SPI Master features one DSP48 block
  + The results from the synchronous SPI channels are piped through
    the DSP48 block. This leads to high throughput while maintaining a
    low resource footprint by not granting a single DSP48 block per
    ADC channel.

- Offset and conversion factor are configurable by software
  individually for each ADC
- Continuous and triggered operation modes
- Hardware trigger interface for real time requirements and software
  trigger interface via AXI4 Lite for convenient usage in case of non
  time-critical applications
- Software control:

  + Software trigger
  + Software reset

- CPHA CPOL and SCLK frequency of the SPI interface are configurable
  by software
- Read only Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI). Only a
  **unidirectional** communication from the ADC to FPGA is possible.
- Single ended output of the core interface. In order to interact with
  the analog adapter board which is connected via LVDS a differential
  buffer needs to be placed at the output of the IP core. The core
  itself only implements the communication logic.


Functional Description
----------------------

The IP core is hierarchically subdivided into five components:

- 1 x ``ADC_LVDS_LTC2311_v3_0``

  + 1 x ``ADC_LVDS_LTC2311_v3_0_S00_AXI``
  + ``SPI_MASTER`` x ``ADC_CONTROLLER``

    - 1 x ``SPI_MASTER`` with ``CHANNELS_PER_MASTER`` synchronous
      channels
    - 1 x ``MULT_ADD``
