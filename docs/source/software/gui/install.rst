Install Java JDK to use GUI
----------------------------

2. Open your terminal and check the installed java version:

3. If it displays something different than your installed version (e.g. version 1.8), you may have already installed some Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
    - Solution A: If you do not explicitly need the JRE --> Uninstall it and check your version again
    - Solution B: Add your JDK installation folder (probably: ``C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-16\bin``) to your system PATH variable
