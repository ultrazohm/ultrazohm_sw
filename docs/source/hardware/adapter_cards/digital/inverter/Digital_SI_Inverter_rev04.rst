Changes from Rev03 production to Rev04
--------------------------------------

* Added separate gate resistors for turn-off (12 Ohm) and turn-on (47 Ohm) MOSFETs.
* Introduced a new capacitor bank consisting of 8x AEC capacitors (110µF each) and 15x MLCCs (10µF each).
* Added an individual 2.5V supply (`REF4132B25DBVRQ1 <https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/ref4132-q1.pdf?ts=1743989231729&ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.ti.com%252Ftool%252FPMP22650>`_) as a bias reference for (ADA4940-1ARZ-R7 and INA241A2IDGKR).
* Replaced Current Sense Amplifier (`MAX40056TAUA+  <https://www.mouser.de/datasheet/2/609/MAX40056F_MAX40056U-3470177.pdf>`_ ).
* New current sensor makes hardware Over Current Protection obsolete.
* Optimized the entire layer stackup and re-engineered the PCB layout.
* Eliminated low-side temperature measurement from all phases.

.. note:: Moved the heatsink in Rev04 to the bottom of the PCB.

Components
----------

Additional to the :ref:`components all version share <dig_si_inverter_all_components>`, the following components are used:

- Bi-directional current measurement `INA241A2IDGKR <https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/ina241a.pdf?ts=1744034830994>`_ 
- 2.5V supply `REF4132B25DBVRQ1 <https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/ref4132-q1.pdf?ts=1743989231729&ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.ti.com%252Ftool%252FPMP22650>`_

Absolute maximum ratings
------------------------

.. warning ::
  - Current up to :math:`I_{peak}=\pm33.94\ A` or :math:`I_{rms}=\pm24\ A`  
  - Voltage up to :math:`V_{peak}=48\ V` or :math:`V_{rms}=33.94\ V`
  - Operating temperature of the MOSFET :math:`T_{j,max}=175°C`


Additional ratings
------------------

.. note ::
  - Current measurement up to :math:`I_{peak,meas}=\pm50\ A`
  - Voltage measurement up to :math:`V_{peak,meas}= 60\ V`
  - Temperature measurement up to :math:`T_{meas}=105°C`
  - Temperature measurement is not built into the MOSFET. Therefore the heat of the PCB close to the semiconductors is measured. The measured temperature will always be **significantly** lower than the max operating temperature of the semiconductors.
  - DC-link capacitance :math:`C_{DC} = 1030\mu F`
  - Cutoff frequency for voltage measurement :math:`f_g = 1745\ Hz` 
  - Operation up to a PWM frequency of :math:`f_{PWM} = 100\ kHz` has been verified
  
Heatsink
--------
:ref:`Rev04 <dig_si_inverter_rev04>` requires a redesigned heatsink, which is not compatible with previous revisions :ref:`Rev02 <dig_si_inverter_rev03>` and :ref:`Rev03 <dig_si_inverter_rev03>`. 
The PCB is prepared for the installation of a heat sink. 
Four mounting holes have been incorporated, designed to support screws with a maximum diameter corresponding to M3.
It is intended that the heatsink will have the appropriate holes with threads into which the screws can be screwed.
For further information on the dimensions of the heatsink and the location of the screw holes, refer to the diagram below. 
The dimensions take into account the safety margin required for the mounting rails in the UltraZohm. 
The heatsink is mounted on the bottom side of the PCB.
Adequate mechanical clearance has been ensured to accommodate the heatsink within the designated space.
A thermal interface material must be applied between the heatsink and the PCB to ensure optimal thermal conductivity.

Compatibility 
-------------

This digital adapter inverter board is directly compatible with the :ref:`uz_inverter_adapter` IP-Core.
It can be used in any of the D1-D4 digital adapter card slots in the UltraZohm, provided the correct CPLD is flashed. 
The card is directly compatible with the :ref:`Analog_LTC2311_16_Rev05`, :ref:`Analog_LTC2311_16_v3` and :ref:`Analog_LTC2311_16_v2` cards.

Switching behavior
-------------------

The Double Puls Test (DPT) was used for characterizing the switching behavior of the design. 
The DC link voltage was set to :math:`V_{dc} = 48\ V`, with a load inductance of :math:`L = 1\ mH` and a load resistance of :math:`R_L = 400\ mΩ`. 
The desired switching current was maintained at :math:`i_D = 30\ A` throughout the test.  
The experimental waveforms of the DPT are shown below. 
One must note that, due to design constraints, measurement of the drain current was not included.
The DC-Current at the negative terminal is therefore shown in the graph.

Setup before first use and implementation with Inverter Interface IP-Core
=========================================================================

CPLD
----

Make sure that the correct CPLD is flashed in the corresponding digital adapter slot.
For this adapter card the ``uz_d_3ph_inverter`` CPLD needs to be flashed.
Download this CPLD from the `UltraZohm CPLD Repository <https://bitbucket.org/ultrazohm/cpld_lattice/src/master/>`_.
Follow :ref:`this guide  <label_cpld_programming>` on how to flash the correct CPLD on the UltraZohm.

Software implementation
-----------------------

This adapter card interacts with the user via the highly sophisticated :ref:`uz_inverter_adapter` IP-Core and its associated driver.
Follow :ref:`this guide <inverter_adapter_usage>` to integrate the IP-Core into the FPGA and to set up the software driver.
While following this guide, be sure to adjust the `linear interpolation parameters` for the ``inverter_adapter_config``. 
For this inverter card they should be:

.. code-block:: c
 :caption: linear interpolation parameters for config struct

 .linear_interpolation_params = {-289.01f, 218.72f}

Set the deadtime in the ``uz_interlockDeadtime2L_staticAllocator.c`` file to an appropriate value. 
A safe value with a considerable safety margin is ``200ns``. 
No matter what, the deadtime should not be lower than ``150ns``.

.. code-block:: c
 :caption: set the deadtime in the ``uz_interlockDeadtime2L_staticAllocator.c`` file. Shown is an example for the D1 slot.

 static uz_interlockDeadtime2L interlock_slotD1_pin_0_to_5 = { 
    .base_address = XPAR_UZ_DIGITAL_ADAPTER_D1_ADAPTER_GATES_UZ_INTERLOCKDEADTIME_0_BASEADDR,
    .clock_frequency_MHz = 100,
    .deadtime_us = 0.2,
    .inverse_bottom_switch = false };

To enable or disable the ``PWM_EN`` for normal operation, add the following code to the isr.c. 
It should always be ensured, that the ``PWM_EN`` is handled correctly. 
I.e. if the UltraZohm transitions into its error-state e.g. because the OCP is triggered, it must be ensured, that the ``PWM_EN`` is retracted.
Pay attention to this during your error handling.

.. code-block:: c
 :caption: Additions for isr.c in regards to the ``PWM_EN``

 if (current_state == running_state || current_state == control_state) {
   // enable inverter adapter hardware
   uz_inverter_adapter_set_PWM_EN(Global_Data.objects.inverter_d1, true);
 } else {
   // disable inverter adapter hardware
   uz_inverter_adapter_set_PWM_EN(Global_Data.objects.inverter_d1, false);
 }


To read out the measured current and voltage signals both ethernet cables have to be connected to an ADC-Card.
In the ``isr.c`` add the following conversion factors to the measured signals.

.. code-block:: c
 :caption: Additions for isr.c if the ADC-Card is in the A1 slot. For the A2/A3 slot adjust the code accordingly

 struct uz_3ph_abc_t v_abc_Volts = {0};
 struct uz_3ph_abc_t i_abc_Amps = {0};
 float v_DC_Volts = 0.0f;
 float i_DC_Amps = 0.0f;
 v_abc_Volts.a = Global_Data.aa.A1.me.ADC_B8 * 12.0f;
 v_abc_Volts.b = Global_Data.aa.A1.me.ADC_B7 * 12.0f;
 v_abc_Volts.c = Global_Data.aa.A1.me.ADC_B6 * 12.0f;
 v_DC_Volts = Global_Data.aa.A1.me.ADC_A1 * 12.0f;
 i_abc_Amps.a = Global_Data.aa.A1.me.ADC_A4 * 12.5f;
 i_abc_Amps.b = Global_Data.aa.A1.me.ADC_A3 * 12.5f;
 i_abc_Amps.c = Global_Data.aa.A1.me.ADC_A2 * 12.5f;
 i_DC_Amps = Global_Data.aa.A1.me.ADC_B5 * 12.5f; 

.. note:: These are the theoretical conversion factors. They might differ slightly in reality do to component tolerances.

In order to use the over current and over temperature protection, the following code has to be added to the isr.c as well. 
These are optional features and can be left out if they aren't required.

.. code-block:: c
 :caption: Additions for isr.c if OTP are used
 
 //Read out overtemperature signal (low-active) and disable PWM and set UltraZohm in error state
 //Overtemperature for H1
 if (!Global_Data.av.inverter_outputs_d1.FAULT_H1) {
    ultrazohm_state_machine_set_error(true);
 }
 //Overtemperature for H2
 if (!Global_Data.av.inverter_outputs_d1.FAULT_H2) {
    ultrazohm_state_machine_set_error(true);
 }
 //Overtemperature for H3
 if (!Global_Data.av.inverter_outputs_d1.FAULT_H3) {
    ultrazohm_state_machine_set_error(true);
 }
