.. _Git:

=============
git + git lfs
=============

Installation
------------

The version control of the source files of the UltraZohm is done by git.
Therefore, a git installation as well as git LFS is required:

#. `git installation <https://git-scm.com/downloads>`_
#. `git lfs installation <https://git-lfs.github.com/>`_

The homepage of git offers excellent `documentation, tutorials <https://git-scm.com/doc>`_, and `videos <https://git-scm.com/videos>`_.
Another `recommended tutorial is offered by Bitbucket <https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials>`_.
An understanding of git is mandatory for working with the UltraZohm and is assumed in the following sections!

A graphical git client can be used to simplify the usage of git.
:ref:`Sourcetree` (Free, Windows and Mac) or `GitKraken <https://www.gitkraken.com>`_ (paid for private repositories, free for students and research institutions/non-profit, Windows, Mac, Linux) is recommended.

Git Bash
--------

If you are comfortable with git bash / CLI tool you can use it without the GUI client.
