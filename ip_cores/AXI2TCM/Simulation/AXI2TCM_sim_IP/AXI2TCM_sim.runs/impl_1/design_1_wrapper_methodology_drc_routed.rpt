2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net aclk_IBUF_inst/O is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): aclk_IBUF_inst/IBUFCTRL_INST/O
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#1 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin design_1_i/AXI2TCM_0/U0/AXI2TCM_v1_0_M00_AXI_inst/ERROR_reg/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#2 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin design_1_i/AXI2TCM_0/U0/AXI2TCM_v1_0_M00_AXI_inst/compare_done_reg/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#3 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin design_1_i/AXI2TCM_0/U0/AXI2TCM_v1_0_M00_AXI_inst/error_reg_reg/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#4 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin design_1_i/AXI2TCM_0/U0/AXI2TCM_v1_0_M00_AXI_inst/init_txn_ff2_reg/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#5 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin design_1_i/AXI2TCM_0/U0/AXI2TCM_v1_0_M00_AXI_inst/init_txn_ff_reg/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#6 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin design_1_i/AXI2TCM_0/U0/AXI2TCM_v1_0_M00_AXI_inst/mst_exec_state_reg[0]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#7 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell
