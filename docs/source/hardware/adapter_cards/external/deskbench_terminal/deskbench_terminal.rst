General description
*******************
This PCB is designed to connect a 3-phase PMSM with a resolver to the Deskbench.
The PCB is housed in an enclosure and serves as an interface between the Deskbench and an inverter, typically the :ref:`dig_si_inverter_rev03`.

Variants
*********

The PCB comes in two variants: one with an optional motor brake connection and another one without it.
Currently, only the variant without the brake connection is used.
