General description
*******************

This PCB is designed to supply external torque sensor `Burster 8656 Torque Sensor <https://www.burster.com/en/torque-sensors/p/detail/8656/>`_  and send the signals to the :ref:`Analog_LTC2311_16` Card
The supply is taken from the voltage interface connector of an :ref:`Analog_LTC2311_16` board.
The torque signal (+-10V) is reduced to a level of +-5V and low-pass filtered. 
The torque signal is connected to ADC1 channel of LTC2311 and the remaining 3 Channels ADC2-ADC 4 can still be used via the Application Input Port

  Functional areas of the uz per torque pcb

Layout
------

The PCB is structured by functional areas as shown in the :numref:`ADC_Loopback_Layout` on the right.


1. Double Ethernet connector to ADC Card
2. Voltage reduction to +-5V and low-pass filtering.
3. Supply voltage 24V from ADC Card with Samtec (3V3, 5V, 15V, 24V)
4. Connector to the Torque Sensor D-Sub 15
