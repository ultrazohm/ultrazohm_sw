    JLC - Shipping

.. note:: After JLC shipped the manufactured PCBs and you received the shipping number, a custom declaration (Zollvoranmeldung) has to be done for this shipment via `DHL Express website <https://www.dhl.de/de/geschaeftskunden/express/produkte-und-services/formular-zollabfertigung.html>`_. This is to avoid the package getting stock in customs.
