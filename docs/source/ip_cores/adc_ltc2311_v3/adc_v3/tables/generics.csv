Parameter Name,Allowable Values,Default Values,VHDL Type,Description
DATA_WIDTH,1 - 24,16,``natural``,Data output width of the connected SPI slave (i.e. ADC)
CHANNELS_PER_MASTER,1 - 32,8,``natural``,Number of SPI slaves that are controlled synchronously by one SPI master
SPI_MASTER,1 - 32,1,``natural``,Number of independent SPI masters
OFFSET_WIDTH,1 - ``DATA_WIDTH``,16,``natural``,Bit width of the offset value which is added to the raw value
CONVERSION_WIDTH,1 - 18,18,``natural``,Bit width of the conversion value the sum of the offset and the raw value is multiplied with
RES_LSB,0 - ``DATA_WIDTH`` + ``CONVERSION_WIDTH`` - 1,6,``natural``,LSB of the result vector of the DSP48 block which is connected to the IP core ``SI_VALUE`` output
RES_MSB,0 - ``DATA_WIDTH`` + ``CONVERSION_WIDTH`` - 1,23,``natural``,MSB of the result vector of the DSP48 block which is connected to the IP core ``SI_VALUE`` output
DIFFERENTIAL, ``true`` ``false``, ``true``, ``boolean``, If true differential buffers are instantiated for SCLK and MISO ports. Otherwise standard CMOS buffers are instantiated
