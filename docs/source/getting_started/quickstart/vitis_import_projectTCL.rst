=======================================
Import project to Vitis with tcl-script
=======================================

Background
----------

* This is the standard way to get the project from Bitbucket!
* From GIT you will get "export" files (1) which uses the xsa file from Vivado (2), in order to build the workspace for Vitis (3)
* After you get the software from Bitbucket, the workspace folder doesn't exist. It will be created automatically.

..	image:: ./images_import_TCL/vitis_createTCL0.png

* In the folder "export" is a TCL-script (8),which automatically builds the Vitis workspace.
* Therefore, the source files for the Baremetal (4), the FreeRTOS (5) and the First-Stage-Bootloader (FSBL) (5) are used.
* In the end of this chapter, the debug configurations can be also included, by clicking on the bat file (7).

2. Create a new workspace in Vitis

..	image:: ./images_import_TCL/vitis_createTCL3.png

3. Click on Window -> Show viewâ€¦

..	image:: ./images_import_TCL/vitis_createTCL4.png

4. Open Xilinx -> XSCT Console

5. Copy the following lines to the console one-by-one:

::

   cd [getws]
   source {../export/generate_UltraZohm_workspace.tcl}

6. And wait for 10-15 minutes

..	image:: ./images_import_TCL/vitis_createTCL6.png
