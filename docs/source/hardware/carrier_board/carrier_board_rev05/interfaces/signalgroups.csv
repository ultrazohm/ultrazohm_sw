Color, Conceptual name, Direction, Voltage level, Explanation
Black,5x PILOT_OUT / Output-Enable,S³C → Slot connector,3V3, Final “enable the card’s outputs” to the slot signal. One line per slot
Blue,FLT(Safe-state request), S³C → Slot Controller,1V8, Asserted whenever any fault or the external stop asks the whole system to go safe. All slot controllers must react to it
Purple,CarrierRdy (×1),S³C → Slot Controller,1V8, Tells the slot controller that the main carrier (SoC + power rails etc.) is up and running
Red,5x !FLT – per-slot fault,Slot Controller → S³C,1V8, Each slot pulls its own line low to request a safe state (over-current/temperature/firmware error …)
Green,5x OE, Slot Controller → S³C,1V8, The slot’s internal AND of PILOT_IN (card’s “I’m ready” signal) and its own health. High = “it is safe to enable my outputs”
Grey, (PILOT_IN; becomes FLT after fusion in slot c.),Slot connector → Slot Controller,3V3, becomes FLT after fusion in slot c.)” just reminds you that the raw card OK contact is used locally inside each slot controller when it builds its OE and fault logic
