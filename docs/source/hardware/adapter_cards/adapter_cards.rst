Create your own adapter cards
=============================

The UltraZohm project is work in progress project and you are welcome to contribute!
To create a adapter card fork one of the following template repositories:
for a `Digital Adapter Card <https://bitbucket.org/ultrazohm/uz_d_template/>`_
or for an `Analog Adapter Card <https://bitbucket.org/ultrazohm/uz_a_template/>`_

Guidelines
----------

If you create an adapter card please make sure you follow the guidelines:

* Discuss your idea in the community. Someone might be designing a similar PCB right now. 
* Take the opportunity to get feedback from the community, e.g. using the issue tracker in the repo. 
* Please test your PCB design thoroughly and provide matching software/IP core drivers, so that others can re-use your design.
* Write a docs page documenting the intended use, technical specifications, limitations, and (if applicable) any known bugs.
* We differentiate between **analog** and **digital** adapter cards. They differ in the number of pins available and how they are routed. For example, the **analog** adapter has 10 fully differential signals, whereas the **digital** adapter has 30 single-ended signals that are routed through a CPLD. Please check the Carrier Board for more details
* Include a version number. It follows the scheme <major_revision>v<minor_revision>. The major revisions are typically produced in hardware and minor revisions are revisions in the layout without producing the PCB.
* Include the designer of the PCB with optionally a contact (e.g. QR-Code or e-mail address).
