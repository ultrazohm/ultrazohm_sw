
== XCP Basic Driver

In this directory the XCP Basic Driver can be found.

It has adaptions to the fit the UltraZohm project:

 - vector/xcp_cfg.h: Adapt configuration defines
 - vector/XcpBasic.h: Add bytes to the Command/Data Transfer Objects (DTO/CTO)
 to hold the XCP-header for Ethernet implementation. This is a performance
 improvement

The 'XCP Basic Driver' can be downloaded from www.vector.com.
The original files, necessary for this project, without adaptions can be found
in the .zip archive `vector/original_XCP_Basic_Driver.zip`
