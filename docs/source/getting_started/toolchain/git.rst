Installation
------------

The version control of the source files of the UltraZohm is done by git.

Therefore, a git installation is needed: <https://git-scm.com/downloads>.

The homepage of git offers excellent documentation <https://git-scm.com/doc>, tutorials and videos <https://git-scm.com/videos>.
Another recommended tutorial is offered by Bitbucket <https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials>.

An understanding on what git is and how it is used is mandatory for working with the UltraZohm and is assumed in the following sections!

To make the usage of git more easy, a graphical git client can be installed in addition to git.
Sourcetree <https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/> (Free, Windows and Mac) or GitKraken <https://www.gitkraken.com> (paid for private repositories, free for students and for research institutions/non-profit, Windows, Mac, Linux) is recommended.

Git Bash
--------

If you are comfortable with git bash / CLI tool you can use it as well to clone the repository.
