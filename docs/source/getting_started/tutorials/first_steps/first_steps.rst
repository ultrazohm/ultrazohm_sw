First steps with the UltraZohm
==============================

Aim of the tutorial
*******************

In this tutorial the initial steps, which are needed to get the UltraZohm running after cloning the repository, are shown.

Requirements
************

The following tutorial requires:

- :ref:`Complete Xilinx Toolchain (Vivado, Vitis) installation <XilinxToolchain>`
- :ref:`Git installation <Git>`
- :ref:`Java installation <install_java>`
- :ref:`Cloned the UltraZohm repositories from Bitbucket <clone>`
- :ref:`Generated Vitis workspace <genvitis>`
- UltraZohm connected to your PC by Ethernet and USB (JTAG)


UltraZohm Setup
***************

The UltraZohm has to be connected to a PC by Ethernet and USB (JTAG-Programmer).

Initial steps
*************

#. Open the Git terminal inside the cloned UltraZohm repository, or alternatively do the following steps via your git-client (e.g. :ref:`Sourcetree`).
#. Change your active branch from ``main`` to ``develop`` by using the **checkout** keyword (e.g. ``git checkout develop`` ).

   * The ``develop`` is the current development branch with the latest merged changes made to the UltraZohm repository. Every new feature branch will be created from this point.
   * The ``main`` branch is the latest stable version. 
   * For further information see :ref:`contribution`. 

#. Create a new local branch with an appropriate name (e.g. *name_tutorial*) on which the changes made throughout the tutorial will be made.

   .. warning:: 

      This branch is only used locally for the tutorials. Do not push any changes to the remote repository.

#. Start **Vitis** and open up the workspace folder ( ``ultrazohm_sw/vitis/workspace`` ) of the UltraZohm repository.

   * Vitis is used, when changes to the code-base on the Processor (PS) have to be made. E.g. if you want to run a control-algorithm on the ARM-Cortex processors of the UltraZohm, you have to make changes in Vitis.
   * Vivado is used, when changes to the programmable logic (PL) on the FPGA have to be made. 
  
#. Build the project by clicking on the red highlighted hammer visible in :numref:`build_workspace`.

   * Whenever changes have been made to the code base. This button has to always be pressed.
   * If this button is not pressed after changes have been made, these changes can't be flashed onto the UltraZohm and the previousely build binary is programmed (without the changes!).

   ..  _build_workspace:

       Building the workspace

#. If you haven't made any changes to the code-base after the :ref:`generation of the Vitis workspace <genvitis>`, the build will lead to errors depicted below.

   * Whenever you made changes to the codebase and the build leads to errors, they have to be fixed, otherwise the UltraZohm can **not** be flashed properly. This is because the errors stop the compiler from compiling the entire workspace.
   * Whilst Warnings do not prohibit the UltraZohm from working, they should be fixed nonetheless.

   ..  _workspace_error:
   ..  figure:: ./img/workspace_error.png
       :align: center

       Errors after building the workspace

#. These errors exist, because the file ``uz_global_configuration.h`` doesn't exist.

   * This file is the configuration file for the UltraZohm and has to be adjusted to your specific needs. 
   * For how to create this missing file see :ref:`global_configuration`.
   * After you copied the contents of ``default_uz_global_configuration.h`` into the new file, no changes except the ``UZ_HARDWARE_VERSION`` have to be made. Adjust this number to the version number of *your* UltraZohm.

#. Build the workspace again. No error should pop up anymore.
#. Flash the UltraZohm by either pressing the run icon in the green highlighted area in :numref:`debug_config` and select *Debug Configurations ...*. Vitis will remember the last selection, which means, that for a future flashing operation, the last debug config is already preselected. 
#. Use for the debug/run selection the ``Run_UltraZohm`` configuration.

   ..  _debug_config:
   ..  figure:: ./img/debug_config.png
       :align: center

       Debug configuration in Vitis.

#. If the flashing was successful, the **Ready LED** will blink slowly.
#. Make sure, that you have configured your Ethernet-to-USB adapter according to :ref:`this guide<GUI_network>`.
#. Start the **uz_GUI** in the folder ``ultrazohm_sw/javascope`` by double clicking on the ``UZ_GUI.jar`` file or executing the ``javascope_run.bat`` file.

#. Press the **Connect** button in the GUI. Now the GUI should be up and running. 

   * If the connection was successful, the field left of the IP-address is moving. 
   * If nothing happens, checkout the :ref:`known issues section <GUI_network>`.

#. Five default channels are visible in the scope after pressing the *sendSelectData (all)* button. 

   * To get the signals into the scope view, adjust the scaling of the first 3 channels.
   * Adjust the time base of the Scope via the *setTime* button and the dropdown menu to ``x10`` .
   * FYI, the values for the channels *theta_mech* and *ua* are in the default case 0.

       Visible signals after GUI has been connected.

#. Get yourself familiar with the GUI by trying different things in the GUI. For further information read the :ref:`sections about the Setup Scope Page, Control Page and Logging Panel <JavaScope>`.
#. In the next tutorial changes will be made to the code-base and the GUI will be customized.
