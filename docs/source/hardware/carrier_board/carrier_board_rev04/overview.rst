========

An overview about interfaces is shown in chapter  :ref:`label_carrier_board_overview`.

Short summary of new features:
------------------------------------------------------

* new connector for front panel buttons and LEDs to provide the isolated GPIO interface available for other purposes (e.g. interaction with external systems)
* external stop circuitry integrated on isolated GPIO interface
* second ethernet port
* GTH lanes on analog socket A1 available
* GTR lanes on new SATA sockets available
* simplified power supply of 1V8_PER (now: uses same DCDC as 1V8_MOD)
